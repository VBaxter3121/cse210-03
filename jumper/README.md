# Jumper
Jumper is a game similar to Hangman. You must guess a randomly chosen word.
You guess one letter at a time. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed, otherwise the jumper's parachute will
loose some pieces.
If the parachute is destroyed, you loose.
If you complete the word, you win.
